# UI Value

| Item                                            | Purpose                                                                   | Who benefits                                                | Does it belong here (and where if not)                                                                                                                                                  |

| App title (“Merossity”)                         | Brand/identity; confirms you’re in the right app                          | Everyone                                                    | Yes, top-left is standard and works                                                                                                                                                     |
| Account line (email + API host)                 | Confirms which account/environment you’re controlling (prod vs alt)       | Power users, developers, anyone with multiple accounts      | Partially: good in header, but visually reads like “debug/status”; consider tucking into an account menu (“Connected as…”, “API: …”)                                                    |
| “COPY KEY” button                               | Copies an API key/token for use elsewhere                                 | Developers/power users                                      | Probably not: it’s a high-power action in the primary header; move to Settings/Account (with explicit label like “Copy API token”) and consider gating/visibility (e.g., “Reveal/Copy”) |
| “Devices” section header                        | Establishes the primary content area                                      | Everyone                                                    | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| “STREAM: LIVE” pill                             | Indicates live updates/streaming status                                   | Everyone, especially when debugging “why didn’t it update?” | Maybe: it’s relevant to Devices, but feels global; consider placing near other global connection state (header/status bar) or pairing it with a toggle (“Live updates: On/Off”)         |
| Circular refresh icon near section header       | Manual refresh of device list/state                                       | Everyone                                                    | Yes, but clarify scope: label/tooltip (“Refresh all”) and avoid ambiguity vs per-device refresh                                                                                         |
| “CIDR (OPTIONAL)” input                         | Narrows network scan range; speeds discovery                              | Power users                                                 | Likely not on the main dashboard: belongs under “Discovery / Scan settings” or an “Advanced” disclosure; on the dashboard it competes with the primary job (control devices)            |
| CIDR helper text                                | Explains what CIDR does and default behavior                              | Power users                                                 | Only if the CIDR input stays; otherwise move with it                                                                                                                                    |
| “READY TO CONTROL” label                        | Separates “discovered” vs “controllable” states (or just a section intro) | Everyone                                                    | Maybe: helpful if there are multiple states/queues; if everything shown is controllable anyway, it’s redundant and could be removed                                                     |
| Small circle with number (“8”)                  | Likely device count / notifications / ready count                         | Everyone                                                    | Yes if it’s a count, but it’s visually disconnected; put it inline with “Devices (8)” or “Ready to control (8)” so it’s unambiguous                                                     |
| Device card (overall)                           | Primary control unit per device                                           | Everyone                                                    | Yes, this is the core of the dashboard                                                                                                                                                  |
| Device name (“Bedroom Light”, etc.)             | Human-friendly identification                                             | Everyone                                                    | Yes, top-left of card is right                                                                                                                                                          |
| Small number badge (“1”)                        | Likely channel/instance count, or unread/events                           | Power users (unless it’s meaningful to all)                 | If it’s always “1”, it’s noise; if it’s channels/groups, keep but label/iconify (e.g., “1ch”) and place near technical metadata instead of the title                                    |
| “LAN: ON/OFF” chip                              | Shows local connectivity mode/availability                                | Everyone, especially reliability-focused users              | Yes, but consider making it more actionable/explanatory (tap for details, or show why OFF)                                                                                              |
| Device type/model line (“SMART WI-FI PLUG / …”) | Hardware identification for troubleshooting                               | Power users                                                 | Borderline on main view; consider collapsing into Details, or show only when there’s an issue                                                                                           |
| IP address line                                 | Network troubleshooting                                                   | Power users                                                 | Better in Details by default; surface only when scanning/debugging mode is enabled                                                                                                      |
| Power toggle + “POWER” label                    | Primary action: turn device on/off                                        | Everyone                                                    | Yes; it’s correctly prominent on the right                                                                                                                                              |
| Per-device circular refresh icon                | Refresh/poll that device’s state                                          | Power users                                                 | Yes, but only if it truly refreshes just that card; consider a less prominent placement or combine with a kebab menu to reduce icon clutter                                             |
| “DETAILS” button                                | Expands advanced controls/info                                            | Everyone (more for power users)                             | Yes; placement at bottom is standard, but consider making the whole card expandable to reduce “buttoniness”                                                                             |

If you want, I can also call out what’s missing from the dashboard for the same three questions (search/filter, rooms/groups, global “all off”, error/offline explanations), but I stuck strictly to what’s visible in the screenshot.
